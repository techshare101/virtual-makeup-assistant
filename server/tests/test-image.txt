To test the Vision API, you'll need to:

1. Save a test image (like a selfie or face photo) as 'test-image.jpg' in the server/tests directory
2. Make sure your google-credentials.json file is in the project root
3. Run the test using: npm run test-vision

The test will verify:
- If the credentials are loaded correctly
- If the Vision API can be accessed
- If face detection works properly
